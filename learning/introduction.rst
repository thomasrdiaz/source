Why isn't this working? There's supposed to be a rude salutation here:


.. helloworld::

It seems like the code for helloworld is not getting rebuilt, or the rebuilt
version is not being used.  That's what was wrong on the Mac, too.

Actually, when I touched this file to write the above, the new, rude helloworld test appeared.

This is a first hack of reStructuredText and sphinx.  Already having braino problems.  I wonder if the OS tacked on a file extension and that was what fucked me up on Windows.\
